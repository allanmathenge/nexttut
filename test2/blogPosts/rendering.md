**Rendering** converts the code you write into user interfaces. Nextjs code can be rendered on the **client** or **server**.

**Environment** mean code can be executed on the client or server. **The Request-Response Lifecycle** is initiated when the user interacts with your app.

**Network boundary** separates server and the client code. _use client_ is client code. By default nextjs components are server side.
